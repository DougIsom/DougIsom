- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DougIsom
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a web designer/font end developer working in the Bootstrap framework. I'm interested in using Github as a cloud based storage solution so I can access projects from anywhere.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to utilize Github with MS Visual Studio Code so I can have a familiar, consistent environemnt on either my mac or Chromebook.
